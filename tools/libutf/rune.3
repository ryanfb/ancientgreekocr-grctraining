.Sh DESCRIPTION
The following functions convert to and from a UTF-8 byte stream and Unicode runes.
.Pp
.Fn runetochar
converts one rune at
.Fa p
to at most
.Dv UTFmax
bytes starting at
.Fa s ,
and returns the number of bytes copied.
.Dv UTFmax
is the maximum number of bytes required to represent a rune.
If the rune is illegal,
.Fn runetochar
will return 0.
.Pp
.Fn chartorune
converts at most
.Dv UTFmax
bytes starting at
.Fa s
to one rune at
.Fa p ,
and returns the number of bytes copied.
If the input is invalid UTF-8,
.Fn chartorune
will convert the sequence to
.Dv Runeerror
(0xFFFD) and return the number of bytes in the invalid sequence.
.Pp
.Fn charntorune
converts at most
.Fa len
bytes starting at
.Fa s
to one rune at
.Fa p ,
and returns the number of bytes copied.
If the next sequence is longer than
.Fa len
bytes,
.Fn charntorune
will return 0.
.Pp
.Fn runelen
returns the number of bytes required to convert the rune
.Fa r
into UTF-8.
If the rune is illegal,
.Fn runelen
will return 0.
.Pp
.Fn runenlen
returns the number of bytes required to convert the
.Fa len
runes pointed to by
.Fa p
into UTF-8.
.Pp
.Fn fullrune
returns 1 if the first
.Fa len
bytes of the UTF-8 string
.Fa s
form a complete rune, and 0 otherwise.
.Pp
The following functions are analogous to the corresponding string routines, with `utf' substituted for `str', and `rune' for `chr'.
.Pp
.Fn utfecpy
copies UTF-8 sequences until a nul byte has been copied, but writes no sequences beyond
.Fa end .
If any sequences are copied,
.Fa to
is terminated with a nul byte and a pointer to that byte is returned.
Otherwise the original
.Fa to
is returned.
.Pp
.Fn utflen
returns the number of runes represented by the UTF-8 string
.Fa s .
.Pp
.Fn utfnlen
returns the number of runes represented by the first
.Fa len
bytes of the UTF-8 string
.Fa s .
If the final sequence is incomplete it will not be counted.
.Pp
.Fn utfrune
.Pq Fn utfrrune
returns a pointer to the first
.Pq last
occurrence of the rune
.Fa r
in the UTF-8 string
.Fa s ,
or
.Dv NULL
if there is none.
The terminating nul byte is considered a part of the string
.Fa s .
.Pp
.Fn utfutf
returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the UTF-8 string
.Fa t
as a UTF-8 substring of
.Fa s ,
or
.Dv NULL
if there is none.
If
.Fa t
is the null string,
.Fn utfutf
returns
.Fa s .
.Sh CONFORMING TO
These functions are compatible with those defined in the Plan 9 C library, with the exception of
.Fn charntorune ,
which is an extension.
However, these functions are much stricter about UTF-8 validity than their Plan 9 counterparts (the kind from up there).
