Source files for some automatically generated parts of the Ancient
Greek (grc) training for Tesseract OCR. Specifically, this contains
the Makefile and its prerequisites to build the following files
needed for the grc training:

- training_text.txt
- grc.word.txt
- grc.freq.txt
- grc.unicharambigs
- grc.wordlist


# Dependencies

The tools from the grctrainingtools repository need to be built.
Get them from
  https://gitorious.org/ancient-greek-training-for-tesseract/grctrainingtools

Once built, their directories need to be added to the PATH environment
variable, e.g.
  PATH=$PATH:/path/to/grctrainingtools


# To build the training parts

Note that the build starts by downloading and unpacking a text
corpus from which to generate the wordlists.

Make all of the parts with the command:
  make
