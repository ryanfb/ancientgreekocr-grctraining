Source files for some automatically generated parts of the Ancient
Greek (grc) training for Tesseract OCR. Specifically, this contains
the Makefile and its prerequisites to build the following files
needed for the grc training:

- training_text.txt
- grc.word.txt
- grc.freq.txt
- grc.unicharambigs
- grc.wordlist


# Dependencies

The tool tlgu is required. Download and install it from:
  http://tlgu.carmen.gr/

On a Mac with homebrew, install coreutils and gnu-sed (needed for
gsed, gmktemp, gshuf).

# To build the training parts

Note that the build starts by downloading and unpacking a text
corpus from which to generate the wordlists.

Make all of the parts with the command:
  make
