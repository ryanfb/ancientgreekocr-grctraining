grctraining
===========

This repository contains source files and tools to build the
prerequisites for the Ancient Greek (grc) training for Tesseract
OCR.

It also contains the rules to optionally build the training using
the generated files.

To build prerequisites
----------------------

Note that the build starts by downloading a text corpus and
dictionary from which to generate the wordlists.

The build process requires git, wget, a C compiler.

If you change allchars.txt, you will also need the pango and cairo
development libraries, which are used to calculate character
metrics.

Make all of the prerequisites with the command:
  make langdata

To build training
-----------------

To build the grc.traineddata the Tesseract training tools and
tesstrain.sh script needs to be on your path (typically this will
involve adding the tesseract/training directory to $PATH).

Note that the prerequisites will be built first if they have not
been already, and that a collection of fonts used for training
will be downloaded.

You can then build the training using this command:
  make grc.traineddata

Downloading needed dependencies
-------------------------------

Several dependencies are automatically downloaded and verified by
the build process:

- The Perseus canonical-greekLit text corpus
- The rigaudon repository for Bruce Robertson's dictionary
- A collection of fonts from the Greek Font Society
