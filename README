# Dependencies

The tools from the grctrainingtools and tesstrainingtools repositories
need to be built. Get them from
https://gitorious.org/ancient-greek-training-for-tesseract

Once built, their directories need to be added to the PATH environment
variable, e.g.
  PATH=$PATH:$HOME/grctrainingtools:$HOME/tesstrainingtools


# To build an OCR training file

Note that the build starts by downloading and unpacking the wordlist
and png/box files.

Make the training with the command:
  make


# To manually download the wordlist and png/box files

If for some reason the wordlist and png/box file download fails, you
can manually download and unpack the following files:
  https://www.dur.ac.uk/nick.white/grctraining/wordlist.bz2
  https://www.dur.ac.uk/nick.white/grctraining/pngbox.tar.bz2
and make an empty file called "getdeps". You can then run "make" and
the training will proceed as normal.


# To rebuild the word lists

The word lists are generated from Perseus' "opensource" corpus. A
pre-built copy is available (see above for the URL), but to rebuild it
do the following:

- Download and unpack Perseus' "opensource" corpus from
  http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/opensource/downloads/texts/hopper-texts-GreekRoman.tar.gz
  and set PERSEUSDIR in the Makefile to the directory to which you
  unpacked them.

- Run the command:
  make wordlist


# To rebuild the png & box files

The png & box files use fonts from the Greek Font Society. A pre-built
copy is available (see above for URL), but to rebuild them do the
following:

- Download all of the OpenType miniscule fonts except "GFS Goschen
  Cursive" and "GFS Theokritos" from http://greekfontsociety.gr and
  unpack them into a directory called "gfsfonts".

- Run the following commands:
  make garbage
  masstrain-fontdir.sh gfsfonts garbage build/pngbox
